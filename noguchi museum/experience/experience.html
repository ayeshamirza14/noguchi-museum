    The Noguchi museum was designed and created by the Japanese-American sculptor Isamu Noguchi. 
    The purpose of this museum is to display Noguchi’s sculptures, architectural models, stage designs and drawings. 
    What I really enjoyed about this museum was how the space was utilized and the artworks were really interacting with the environment. 
    It was really interesting and unique to experience that because I don’t see that in many museums. 
    It’s as if the space completes each artwork.  Also, the lighting and spotlights were placed thoughtfully, to enhance specific areas of an artwork. 
    Kind of highlight what the artist wants you to see. The artworks are very abstract, all somehow connected to each other in a way. 
    I also like how the size of the museum is small, giving me the illusion “a house of Nouchi’s artwork” rather than a museum - which I really liked because there was a theme to the overall place of the artworks. 
    Which really  emphasizes these simple abstract artworks.
